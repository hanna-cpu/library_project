Library Project was my A Level project at school. I built this project using Python Reflex Reflex Framework. https://reflex.dev/

I have made comments in the files so its veru good for learning and understanding.

I used Reflex as I can create Frontend also in Python. No Need HTML , CSS or Java Script.

This program provides the following:

This program is a 3 tier architecture, has a Sql Lite database. I created sqlite DB using DBeaver and manually created tables and entered data. The program has separate FrontEnd files and BackEnd files. they are clearley separated in different folders.

This whole project is built using Reflex Python Frame work on visual Studio.

How to Run :

Clone this repo to your computer.

create a new python virtual environment.

install the reflex : pip install reflex NOTE: I used reflex 0.8 , it may not work with later versions or older

goto the folder and run : reflex run

reflex compiles the code and creates a webserver on port 3000.

goto http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
